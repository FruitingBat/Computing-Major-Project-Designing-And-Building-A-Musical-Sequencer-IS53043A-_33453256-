Here are the Csound and VST files for my final computing project.

To run the VST plugins you must have Cabbage and Csound installed on your computer. The csd and dll files must be in the same folder for the VST plugin to work. The dll files will only run on Windows. To create VST plugins for other platforms, you must compile the csd file into a dll file from within Cabbage.

sequencerSquareWave is prototype one. Can be ran as a VST plugin without the need for Launchpad Mini Mk2 hardware.
sequencerEuclidean is prototype two.  Can not run as a VST plugin without the Launchpad Mini Mk2 hardware.
sequencerArrayTestBroken does not work as intended and is not commented. This file is included purely to demonstate how prototype two could be optimised.
